This is a react-native boilerplate for a simple app with a TabBar, a Redux data store and external Api call via redux-api-middleware

- Platform independent TabBar implementation
- React-native-router-flux as router implementation (using Scene instead of Route)
- redux-api-middleware for external api call
- Using redux-logger for logging
- ES6 syntax throughout
- Code organized in simple directory structure

Notes:
- Android not tested (yet)
